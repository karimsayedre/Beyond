# Beyond Engine  

**Beyond Engine** is a modern, high-performance graphics engine built using Vulkan, designed with flexibility, scalability, and cutting-edge rendering techniques in mind.  

Initially developed as a fork of the Hazel Engine, Beyond Engine has undergone extensive optimizations and feature additions, including state-of-the-art technologies such as DLSS and ray tracing. It is the culmination of a relentless pursuit of rendering excellence.  

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the Studio Cherno for laying the foundation and everyone who contributed to the development and success of Hazel Engine which served as the starting point for Beyond Engine.
